# PostHog feature flags for Android

This skill helps you add PostHog feature flags to Android applications.

## Reference files

- `references/android.md` - Android feature flags installation - docs
- `references/adding-feature-flag-code.md` - Adding feature flag code - docs
- `references/best-practices.md` - Best practices for production-ready flags - docs
- `references/COMMANDMENTS.md` - Framework-specific rules the integration must follow

Consult the documentation for API details and framework-specific patterns.

## Key principles

- **Environment variables**: Always use environment variables for PostHog keys. Never hardcode them.
- **Minimal changes**: Add feature flag code alongside existing logic. Don't replace or restructure existing code.
- **Boolean flags first**: Default to boolean flag checks unless the user specifically asks for multivariate flags.
- **Server-side when possible**: Prefer server-side flag evaluation to avoid UI flicker.

## PostHog MCP tools

Check if a PostHog MCP server is connected. If available, look for tools related to feature flag management (creating, listing, updating, deleting flags). Use these tools to manage flags directly in PostHog rather than requiring the user to do it manually in the dashboard.

## Framework guidelines

- A missing PostHog configuration must never break the app — read keys optionally (never a required setting), guard init and capture behind their presence, and keep build and boot working with no PostHog environment set — but never silently: in development or debug builds fail loudly, using the language's idiomatic error, with the message "<VAR> variable required by PostHog is missing or un-configured, this causes events to be silently missed. This error stops appearing once <VAR> is configured" (substituting the actual variable name); production stays a no-op
- Adapt dependency configuration to the appropriate build.gradle(.kts) file according to the project gradle version
- Call `PostHogAndroid.setup()` only once in the Application class's `onCreate()` method, so it's initialized as early as possible and only once.
- Initialize PostHog in the Application class's `onCreate()` method
- Ensure every activity has a `android:label` to accurately track screen views.
