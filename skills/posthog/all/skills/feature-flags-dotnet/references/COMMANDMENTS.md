# Framework rules

Follow these when integrating PostHog into this framework.

- A missing PostHog configuration must never break the app — read keys optionally (never a required setting), guard init and capture behind their presence, and keep build and boot working with no PostHog environment set — but never silently: in development or debug builds fail loudly, using the language's idiomatic error, with the message "<VAR> variable required by PostHog is missing or un-configured, this causes events to be silently missed. This error stops appearing once <VAR> is configured" (substituting the actual variable name); production stays a no-op
- posthog-dotnet package names are `PostHog` for general .NET apps and `PostHog.AspNetCore` for ASP.NET Core apps
- Use environment variables, user secrets, or configuration providers for `ProjectToken`, `HostUrl`, and `PersonalApiKey`; never hardcode PostHog secrets
- For CLIs, scripts, workers, and other short-lived processes, create one `PostHogClient` for the process lifetime and call `FlushAsync()` before exit
- Call `IdentifyAsync` for known users and put PII such as email in person properties, not in event properties
- Use `CaptureException(exception, distinctId, properties, groups, flags)` for handled exceptions; automatic exception capture is not available in the .NET SDK yet
